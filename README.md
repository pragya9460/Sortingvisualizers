## How it works ?!
-------------------
**Here in our model, each element value is represented by ```THE SIZE OF THE BAR``` and the algorithms sort them by placing the smallest elements on the left and the biggest elements on the right**

**The algorithms moves the items around by swapping elements, Without using any additional memory with creating another array.**
